I believe this is for a WowWee RoboRaptor; see https://web.archive.org/web/20091229100647/http://www.wowwee.com/static/support/roboraptor/manuals/Roboraptor_Manual.pdf
I only have the controller (see images). It looks the same as the one in the manual except there's a button on
the front at the right with a Target icon on it.
