# there is a center key on remote as well, but Flipper does not record anything, and it does not do anything to vacuum. Or my remote has broken key =)
# timings are measured around 5 times per signal, then averaged and rounded
# currently manual drive is jerky, while with original remote it is smooth
# be careful not to burn motors on manual drive
# any improvements are welcome
